# nfportalutils

![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/nf-osi/nfportalutils/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg?branch=develop)

The goal of `nfportalutils` is to provide convenience functions for
project and (meta)data management in the NF-OSI data portal scope.
Currently, `develop` branch is default so package install and docs refer
to code in this branch.

The package interops with the [Python synapse
client](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/synapsePythonClient) via
reticulate. You will have to set up both (see \#Installation). Outside
of the tested versions, there may be some issues. The tested versions
are: - Python Synapse Client == 4.3.1 - reticulate == 1.39.0

## Docs

👉 [Package documentation!](https://nf-osi.github.io/nfportalutils/)

## Installation

This presumes you have already set up R with RStudio.

1.  Install `reticulate` following guide at
    <https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html#installation>.
2.  Install `synapseclient==4.3.1` following
    <https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html>,
    which will use a default environment “r-reticulate”.
3.  Lastly, install `nfportalutils`. At startup, `nfportalutils` imports
    `synapseclient` from the default “r-reticulate”.

- As regular users:
  `remotes::install_github("nf-osi/nfportalutils", build_vignettes = TRUE)`
  or
  `remotes::install_github("nf-osi/nfportalutils@some-branch", build_vignettes = TRUE)`
- For developers, presumably working with `devtools`:
  - Clone the repo, checkout your desired development branch.
  - Make sure the package repo root is working directory, then in R run
    `devtools::install()`.

4.  Browse some vignettes: `browseVignettes("nfportalutils")`.

## For Users

- View function reference on docs site at
  [Reference](https://nf-osi.github.io/nfportalutils/reference/index.html).
- An alternative to viewing vignettes as Articles on the [docs
  site](https://nf-osi.github.io/nfportalutils/index.html) is to
  download them with pkg install and load with
  e.g. [`vignette("annotate-nf-processed-data", package = "nfportalutils")`](articles/annotate-nf-processed-data.md)
  to view.

## For Contributors

### General picture

- Again, default development happens in `develop`.
- But we have a side branch called `develop-synapser` where interop
  tries to transition to `synapser`. However, current coexistence makes
  development a bit tricky so consult first before trying new
  developments there.

### Contrib workflow

- Branch of `develop` and make changes
- Run `devtools::check(vignettes = FALSE)` early and often, and
  definitely before submitting a PR
- Make a pull request to `develop`; this will run `R-CMD-CHECK` and
  `pkgdown`
- Request a reviewer if both checks pass
- Reviewer requests changes or merges

### Local development tips

- Some vignettes need to be
  [precomputed](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/12/08/precompute-vignettes/).
- Again, run `devtools::check(vignettes = FALSE)` early and often.
- At minimal, address any `ERRORS` and `WARNINGS`.
- Yes, we do have a lot of `NOTES` that need to be resolved.
- For custom indexing after adding/updating functions, edit the
  `_pkgdown.yml`.
- Preview the pkg docs site locally with
  [`pkgdown::build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_site.html).
